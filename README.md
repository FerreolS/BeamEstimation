# BeamEstimation.jl

A small tool for fast estimation of the beam ellipse parameters from the uv plane.

### To use it:
Add it to your Julia using `Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/FerreolS/BeamEstimation.jl.git")`

### Notes:
The document describing the computation is
 [![there](https://github.com/FerreolS/BeamEstimation.jl/blob/gh-pages/beam.svg)](https://github.com/FerreolS/BeamEstimation.jl/blob/gh-pages/beam.pdf)

### Notebook
There is an example on [notebooks](https://github.com/FerreolS/BeamEstimation.jl/tree/notebooks).
As Nbviewer cannot show plotly plots properly, it can be directly seen [here](https://jovian.com/ferreols/beamexample). There you can zoom in to compare the image of the beam and the estimated ellipse.
